# CharacterSheet #

About the Program:  
I personally did not like how information was displayed by the character sheets stored online, and I wanted to be able to save my characters locally. I created this with what my friends and I think is the most used information at the front. Since starting this project, I have found some other downloadable character sheet programs but I decided to keep going with this to practice programming.  

Requirements and installation:  
Uses Java 8 and I compile it in intellij idea.
The executable that I provide should be able to be run anywhere, but not that whatever directory it is in it will create a folder named saves. This will probably change, but for now that is where it stores saved character for ease of access.  

Other notes:  
Primarily uses JavaFX in Java 8.  
Saves stored using JAXB.  
If you have any suggestions or issues, please post them! This is my first program outside of college projects and I hope to use it to become better at programming.  
If my license is missing anything or I missed a license I needed to provide, please let me know via the issuetracker on github.
