# Jaracter Sheet #

About the Program:  
I personally did not like how information was displayed by the character sheets stored online, and I wanted to be able to save my characters locally. I created this with what my friends and I think is the most used information at the front. Since starting this project, I have found some other downloadable character sheet programs but I decided to keep going with this to practice programming.
I named it Jaracter Sheet because I am not creative and it is purely a mix between java and character.

Requirements and installation:
The download is located in the compiled folder in github.  
Uses Java 8 and I compile it in intellij idea.
The executable that I provide should be able to be run anywhere, but not that whatever directory it is in it will create a folder named saves. This will probably change, but for now that is where it stores saved character for ease of access.  

Current features and issues:
All features of a standard 5e character sheet are implemented.
Custom initiative bonuses and modifiers, double proficiency, and custom proficiency bonuses are implemented.
Characters are saved in an XML format.
Spellbook currently does not work.


Other notes:
Primarily uses JavaFX in Java 8.  
Saves stored using JAXB.  
If you have any suggestions or issues, please post them! This is my first program outside of college projects and I hope to use it to become better at programming.  
If my license is missing anything or I missed a license I needed to provide, please let me know via the issuetracker on github.
